      <description>I have been meaning to write a post for a long time, but every time I was held down by some other activity, or so I thought. Procrastination is the bane of most inexperienced writers, and in my case, it also reflected in &amp;ldquo;my ways&amp;rdquo; of doing assignments and projects since last two years. I am not saying that procrastination is the only cause of my inactivity, but it does contribute to it a lot.</description>

      <description>Virtual machines are the perfect way of isolating your work environment from your host environment. But when your work is only limited to the user-space programs, this perfect isolation, which comes at the price of performance, is not required.
With the onset of namespaces in linux kernel, the concept of containers (sometimes called lightVM) came to light. Unlike jails, namespaces also isolate and visualize the process&amp;rsquo;s pids, uids, IPC and network access.</description>

      <description>Windows, the most popular operating system, works well for the day-to-day activities but is of little help when it comes to programming and development.
Inspired by seniors, I took my first step towards using Ubuntu, the most popular linux, as my host operating system about a year ago. It felt very uncomfortable at first to use this not-so-good-looking OS. But overtime, the simplicity and the ease of use overshadowed the unsightly UI.</description>
