        <p>Harry Potter(HP) series, one of the most celebrated set of books of all times, always have more to see than meets the eye. Apart from spectacular fantasy world, brilliant writing and interesting plot, you will observe many latent moral lessons. Here&rsquo;re some:</p>

<ol>
    <li><strong>You are not defined by your illness</strong>
    <br/>
    Remus Lupin, a werewolf, did not go to exile like other werewolves. Instead, he conceals his illness and leads a normal life by preparing for full moon days. As mentioned in <a href="https://www.pottermore.com/writing-by-jk-rowling/remus-lupin">Pottermore</a>, Lupin condition is the metaphor of those illnesses that carry a stigma, like HIV and AIDS. He teaches us that whatever disorder or illness one may have, it is important not to define oneself based on it but rather rise above it.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>Challenging the norms</strong>
    <br/>
    HP fantasy world has many parallels with the real world. The discrimination of muggle born wizards is analogous to many forms of discrimination such as casteism, sexism, racism etc. The treatment of house-elves is a depiction of slavery. The rise of Lord Voldemort and the elimination of non-pureblooded wizards remind us of Nazis and Holocaust.
    <br/>
    Not only does HP portray these problems, it also makes reader to look for such things and fix them. Even though, in HP, it never occurred to most peoples to empathize with house-elves, Harry found a way to free Dobby and Hermione fought for their rights. The propaganda of Voldemort and death eaters teach us not to be swayed by eloquent speeches. It is extremely important to not blindly follow the norm and actively look for problems in society.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>Seemingly ordinary peoples can lead extraordinary lives</strong>
    <br/>
    Harry is the characterization of a person who is neither strongest nor smartest, but still he was able to make the difference. He tells us that anyone can succeed with the right attitude and right companion. His character is the reminder that it is our choices that show who we truly are, far more than our abilities. After all, everyone is the protagonist of his/her life.</li>
    <br/>
    <li><strong>Peoples aren't what they look</strong>
    <br/>
    Snape, despised by many, turns out to be a hidden hero. He tells us that the evil looking person who always seems to trouble you actually be your guardian angel. The crazy mad murderer locked in Azkaban might actually be an innocent victim. This, not judging a book by its cover, is a recurrent theme in the Harry Potter series.</li>
</ol>
