<blockquote>
<p>There’s nothing natural or preordained about Indian unity. Indian civilization is antique; Indian unity is rare and recent.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Malevolent republic is a terrifying and hard-hitting account of the political, social, and religious landscape of India, casting merciless eyes upon all prime ministers, from Nehru to Modi, with no corner left untouched. We do perceive pride as a legitimate emotion in the national context. This is the kind of book that would force us to recognize another side of the coin: shame. Should we not be ashamed that even after 73 years of independence, much of this country still struggles to put bread on the plate? So many of us live in the 19th century while few of us live in 21rst century. Misogyny and identity division continue to tear us apart. A country with so much wealth of natural resources (i.e. human resources) should have become a developed nation by now, where people are comfortable in their skin and confident about their place in the world. It is true that our democracy is showing its strain, but these raptures are not only given by the current political dispensation. We have been afflicted for all its years of existence. We owe to ourselves to face our affliction. We can not do it by creating simple binaries today by placing one party upon another. If we want to recover as a nation and give ourselves a reason to be proud indian, we must look inwards with the critical eye. So much that gets wrong gets normalized so fast. We must tear away that layer of normalization and outrage again and outrage constantly and collectively; for outrage is not just our privilege as an Indian citizen, it is our duty.</p>

<p>Starting with his poignant personal reflection in the prologue, the author takes us into an informed and chronological journey of events that made India what it is today. He takes no prisoners. Degradation of political discourse by modifying history into simplistic narrative of recent times should not only be attributed to right wing groups, it was also done by so-called secularists. There was a project of rewriting history, to wipe away what happened in medieval ages. According to them, Imperialism was destructive only when Europeans did it. When Asians did it, it was a cultural exchange programme. We need to accept that islamic invasion was accompanied by extraordinary violence. At some places, there was wholesome destruction of cultural heritage. People at these places do have some memory, inherited from their forefathers; they are shaped by it but can not quite fathom what really was the tragedy. When there is a vacuum, it will be filled by garbage pervaded by current dispensation. We should be honest about our history, and admit that horrible things did happen and should try to move on.</p>

<p>Instead of doing so, the secular establishment did find complex ways of skirting around. Soon it might be the case that in place of history, we have things like Indians colonizing Mars, inventing jets, and gold extraction from cow dung. When we don&rsquo;t know about history, we are bound to become susceptible to garbage. Secular historians did what they did with a noble motive, that is to not give ammunition to hindu nationalist. But they enabled them to weaponize history. History cannot be revenged. The best we can do is strive to emancipate ourselves from its punishing torments by being honest about it. India survives as a union because most people see themselves as Indian first.</p>
