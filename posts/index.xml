      <description>Thereâ€™s nothing natural or preordained about Indian unity. Indian civilization is antique; Indian unity is rare and recent.
 Malevolent republic is a terrifying and hard-hitting account of the political, social, and religious landscape of India, casting merciless eyes upon all prime ministers, from Nehru to Modi, with no corner left untouched. We do perceive pride as a legitimate emotion in the national context. This is the kind of book that would force us to recognize another side of the coin: shame.</description>

      <description>I have been meaning to write a post for a long time, but every time I was held down by some other activity, or so I thought. Procrastination is the bane of most inexperienced writers, and in my case, it also reflected in &amp;ldquo;my ways&amp;rdquo; of doing assignments and projects since last two years. I am not saying that procrastination is the only cause of my inactivity, but it does contribute to it a lot.</description>

      <description>Windows, the most popular operating system, works well for the day-to-day activities but is of little help when it comes to programming and development.
Inspired by seniors, I took my first step towards using Ubuntu, the most popular linux, as my host operating system about a year ago. It felt very uncomfortable at first to use this not-so-good-looking OS. But overtime, the simplicity and the ease of use overshadowed the unsightly UI.</description>
